    public void setInjury(boolean injury){
        if (injury){
            topSpeed = topSpeed / 2;
            System.out.println("This animal is injured!");
        } else {
            mName = "a healthy " + mName;
        }
    }

The top 10 best animals:

*rest

"=="" tries to match the space in memory, so always use .equals instead

if/else vs switch - can use either, one may be cleaner than other

num++ and ++num are different. num++ happens by giving num and then increasing the value. ++num adds b4 num

:sparkles:
